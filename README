Dojo Zazl
---------

Enables developers to run Javascript on the server to render dynamic web pages using the Dojo Toolkit‚Äôs implementation of the Django Template Language.

Quick Start using NodeJS
------------------------

Install NodeJS (>= ver 0.4.0)

The NodeJS package has some prereqs that need to be installed before attempting to use :

1)    paperboy (npm install paperboy)
2)    uglify-js (npm install uglify-js)
3)    jsdom (npm install jsdom)

Once these are installed untar the zazlnodejs.taz.gz file into a directory and within that directory run :

node zazlserver.js <path to files> <path to dojo>

The tar file contains samples and also a copy of Dojo 1.5.0 (required by both Zazl and the samples)
In this case to start run :

node zazlserver.js ./samples ./dojo

Open a browser and point it to http://localhost:8080/index.html

Quick Start using Jetty Server
------------------------------

Select the archive file for your platform (32Bit Windows, 32Bit Linux or 32/64Bit Mac) and uncompressed to your preferred <zazl-install-directory>

To start the server you must do the following:

1. Open a command prompt and point it to the directory: <zazl-install-directory>/server

2. To start Zazl with Rhino:
(Windows) run-zazl-rhino.bat
(Linux/Mac) ./run-zazl-rhino.sh

To start Zazl with V8:
(Windows) run-zazl-v8.bat
(Linux/Mac) ./run-zazl-v8.sh

3. Open a browser to http://localhost:8080/index.html

Setting up a Development Environment
------------------------------------

1) Make a directory called "zazldev" and cd into it.
2) Download the zazlbuild.zip, zazltargetplatform.zip and unzip into the "zazldev" directory. 
3) Clone the Zazl git repo (git clone git://github.com/rbackhouse/zazl.git)

To build without Eclipse :
1) cd into "zazlbuild"
2) Build Zazl via zazlbuild.sh or zazlbuild.bat. The built binaries should be in the subdirectory "zazl/package".

To develop and build with Eclipse:
1) Download a copy of Eclipse 3.6 (http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)
2) Start Eclipse and point it to the "zazldev/zazl" directory. 
3) Import the projects found in the "zazldev/zazl" directory via "File->Import->General->Existing Projects into Workspace".
4) Initially you will have some compile errors
5) Open the "/org.dojotoolkit.zazl.feature/zazltarget.target" file and click the "Set as Target Platform" link in the top right-hand corner. This should make the compile errors go away.
6) To test select the "Run->Run Configurations" menu option, then run the "Zazl Jetty Server (v8)" launch under the OSGi Framework section.
7) In the OSGi console you should see :

osgi> 2011-02-24 10:41:35.192:INFO::Logging to STDERR via org.mortbay.log.StdErrLog
Browse demos at "http://localhost:8080/index.html"

8) Open a browser to http://localhost:8080/index.html

Zazl Build Component
--------------------

The zazl build component includes a copy of Apache Ant and ant4eclipse to enable building without using eclipse itself. Within the “zazlbuild” directory there are scripts to build the Zazl binaries :

    * optimizerbuild.bat/optimizerbuild.sh – Builds the JS Optimizer example WAR file. It will be located in “zazlbuild/optimizer/package”
    * zazlbuild.bat/zazlbuild.sh – Builds the Zazl binaries. They will be located in “zazlbuild/zazl/package”
    * buildzazlnodejs.sh – Builds the Zazl for nodeJS package “zazlnodejs.tar.gz”

Zazl Eclipse Target Platform
----------------------------

The Zazl Target Platform zip file (zazltargetplatform.zip) contains the prereqs that Zazl requires. They are currently :

    * Dojo
    * Eclipse Equinox
    * Apache HTTP Client/Core
    * JSON (https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js)
    * JSP
    * RequireJS
    * Mozilla Rhino
    * Dojo Shrinksafe
    * Uglify-JS
